Assignment 6 Part A

2) 16

3) {

4) Q
To solve this, I found the prime numbers that when multiplied together give you 247, 
which are 13 and 19. I put those two number into KeyGen.java to get the value d which 
is used for decoding, which is 173. I put the value for d, n, and c which was the encoded 
value 9 into Decode.java and the character Q was returned.

5) d = 187
    encryption of message m = 100: 254

6) A,L,X are from Alice
    B is either corrupted or forged because 113 decodes to k using Alice's public key.

7) See EncodeString.java

8) See DecodeInts.java
